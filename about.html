            <h2>I'm eager to learn.</h2>
            <p>"You should learn more" is what my Dad always said. He was right. I decided to give my web skills an upgrade.<br>
            I started out small. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> ... Those kind of things.</p>
            <p>But that got boring pretty quickly and <strong>Udemy</strong> was my next stop. Some courses you should try:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp" target="_blank">The Web Developer Bootcamp</a> - This was the first course I bought on Udemy.<br>And you can learn so much from it: jQuery, Express, <a href="https://codepen.io/emz123/pen/MqJzyP" target="_blank">REST</a> (hang that table above your bed), Mongoose ...<br>It's worth its length in gold!</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-object-oriented-programming">Object-oriented programming in Javascript</a> - "Small" course with little practical stuff here.<br>But there's nobody who can explain "prototypical inheritance" as good as Mosh!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then I spent some time learning the basics of SQL and MongoDB through books and experimentation.<br>Around that time, I decided to get serious with my transformation from marketing to IT. So I set my eyes on a 1,5&nbsp;year <a href="https://www.howest.be/nl/opleidingen/bachelor/toegepaste-informatica/blockchain-developer-and-architect-at-home" target="_blank">course at Howest</a>  named <strong>Blockchain Developer &amp; Architect</strong>. A sneak preview of course content:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hashing and encryption algorithms and how they work under the hood.</li>
                <li>How to set up a <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric" target="_blank">Hyperledger Fabric</a> network.<br>If you're looking for detailed articles about Hyperledger, <a href="http://www.ledgertech.biz/kcarticles.html" target="_blank">Ledger Tech</a> is where you need to be!</li>
                <li>Working with an Arduino Uno and integrating it into a blockchain network (best course ever!)</li>
                <li>More general topics such as security management, IT law, BPM ...</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>I read when I can.</h2>
            <p>Growing up, reading wasn't really my cup of tea. But things changed. Now I'm an avid reader of (mainly) non-fiction books. Let me share some of my favorite books:</p>
