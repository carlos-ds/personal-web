My recap of the 1,5 year curriculum "Blockchain Developer & Architect" at Howest:

### September 22, 2018 - Start of Semester 1
We were guided to a disturbingly old but gigantic classroom, with freshmen and seniors alike. 
It felt strange yet comfortable. After a small introduction, the course overview was presented:

* Blockchain Development I
* Blockchain Architecture I
* Security Management, Threat and Risk Assessment
* Cryptography
* Data Privacy and IT Law
* Security Seminars, Study Visits and Challenges

If it seems a lot, that means it was. I particularly liked the cryptography class because it made me realize that encryption/hashing is not rocket science after all. Sure, it's not easy to get an in-depth understanding and claiming that we truly understood the mechanics is simply ridiculous. But it did give us something to work with.

The last course in the list above was just designed to get us interacting with the technology in an actual business setting. At the end of 2018, we participated in the Howest blockchain hackathon and got the first prize with our concept of sharing household energy (to recharge bicycles, cars, devices ...) in exchange for tokens.
