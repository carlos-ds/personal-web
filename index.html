  <h1>Hi, my name's Karel.<br />I'm a lecturer in web development and open-source contributor.</h1>
  <p>
    I love reading books, taking long walks or driving my kids around by bike.<br />
    I write off and on about my personal experiences. Mostly but not always related to software development.
